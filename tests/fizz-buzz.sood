fizz_buzz is a function of type string with arguments of:
      an integer num; and of statements,

  # neither is a string of value num.
  return ''...

output is a string of value ''.
counter is an integer of value 0.
while counter is less than or equal to number_of_repetitions,
  output is fizz_buzz called with: counter...
  write counter to stdout.
  write ': ' to stdout.
  # TODO: String equality
  write output to stdout.
  # if output is equal to '',
  #   write counter to stdout...
  # else,
  #   write output to stdout...
